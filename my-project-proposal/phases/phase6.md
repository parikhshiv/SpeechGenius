Bonus Work (Remaining Time)

6. Get timestamps on comments down
7. Bonuses: Cool home page that posts links to different speakers, who all have their own speaker show page, videos at the top of song pages,
different genres such as speeches, literature, and word etymologies (the list could go on...).
8. You can edit images... (filepicker probably has some function like this)
9. You can use the keyboard to select through speeches in the speech search bar dropdown.
10. Forums, blogs, etc.

*annotation container should show up next to paragraph for showing individual annotations -
will probably need to add location column to annotations to fix this*
*anchor tags?*
*Make sure and add minimum requirements for length of new speeches*
*Right now, if you highlight an entire sentence, you can replace all or part of that sentence by highlighting over it*
*You can also break a highlight/page by highlighting very close to existing highlights*
*make sure all filepicker is https only (which it may be already)*
*when you highlight, click new annotation, and then cancel out of new annotation form, you can't IMMEDIATELY highlight to get to new annotation link again*
*Only works on chrome!*
