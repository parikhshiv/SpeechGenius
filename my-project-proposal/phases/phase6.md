Bonus Work (Remaining Time)

1. Rework votes controller to make single queries for comments
2. add a fetchSingleSpeech to api_util, that makes a get request to show

*creating and deleting annotations is slow on heroku, and when you reload index after that it goes slow*
*after you create a speech, or create a comment on a speech, its slow to view other speeches*

6. Get timestamps on comments down
7. Bonuses: Cool home page that posts links to different speakers, who all have their own speaker show page, videos at the top of song pages,
different genres such as speeches, literature, and word etymologies (the list could go on...).
8. You can edit images... (filepicker probably has some function like this)
9. You can use the keyboard to select through speeches in the speech search bar dropdown.
10. Forums, blogs, etc.

*Right now, if you highlight an entire sentence, you can replace all or part of that sentence by highlighting over it*
*You can also break a highlight/page by highlighting very close to existing highlights*
*Only works on chrome and safari, not mozilla!*
